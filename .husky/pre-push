# PRE-PUSH SECURITY VERIFICATION
# =============================================================================
# 
# This hook runs comprehensive security verification before pushing to ensure:
# - No secrets are leaked in the repository
# - Environment variables are used correctly
# - Code quality and type safety
# - Build process works correctly
# 
# If verification fails, the push is blocked with clear remediation steps.
