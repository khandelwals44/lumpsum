## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start
1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Set required environment variables
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   # ... (see PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md for full list)
   ```

2. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run typecheck
   npm run build
   # Deploy to Vercel or your preferred platform
   ```
